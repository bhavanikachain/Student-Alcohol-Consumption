Student Alcohol Consumption 
Background : This dataset contains a lot of interesting social, gender and study information about students
In this analysis the data I focused on is the following 
School – students had either attended 'GP' - Gabriel Pereira or 'MS' - Mousinho da Silveira
The students sex
Their weekly study time (1: <2h, 2: 2 - 5 h, 3: 5 – 10h, 5: >10h)
Failures : the number of classes a student fail (0 – 0 classes, 1 – 1 class, 2 – 2 classes, 3 – 3 or more classes)
Whether the were apart of extra curricular activities 
The amount of free time they have ( 1 – the least, 5- the most)
The quality of their family relationships (1 – very bad, 5 – excellent)
How often they go out with friends (1 – very low, 5 – very often)
And lastly, their final grade mark

1. Do Students Background affect their Workday Alcohol Consumption?
Based on the data analysis and visualization I found that :
GP had more students that consumed alcohol on a workday basis that MS did
More students with good family relationships consumed alcohol on a workday bases than those with bad family relationships
Students that did not do extra activities consumed more alcohol on a workday basis
The more free time students had, the more alcohol they consumed 
The more often students went out with friends, the more alcohol they consumed 

2. Does the amount of Alcohol Consumed on Workdays by Students affect their Social life?
Based on the data analysis and visualization I found that :
There are more male students that consume alcohol on a workday basis than females for all categories 
Students that consume less alcohol spend more time studying, especially hours from 2 – 5 hours
Students that consume alcohol more excessively have lower grade than students who don’t 
Students that consume alcohol more excessively have failed more classes than students who don’t 

3. Do Students Background affect their Weekend Alcohol Consumption?
Based on the data analysis and visualization I found that :
More students at GP consume alcohol on weekends than MS
More students with good family relationships consume more alcohol on weekends than those who have bad family relationships
Students that do not take part in extra curricular activities consume more alcohol on weekends than those who do 
The more free time students had, the more alcohol they consumed on weekends
The more often students went out with friends, the more alcohol they consumed on weekends

4. Does the amount of Alcohol Consumed on Weekends by Students affect their school performance?
Based on the data analysis and visualization I found that :
More female students consumed alcohol on weekends for the first 3 categories than male students
Students that consume less alcohol on weekends spend more time studying, especially hours from 2 – 5 hours
Some Students that consume alcohol more excessively on weekends have lower grade than students who don’t, but some of those students also managed to maintain good grades
Students that consume alcohol more excessively on weekends have failed more classes than students who don’t
